How is it possible for users to lose hundreds of dollars in anomalous online bank transfers when all of their gadgets have security software installed?
Last year, user Y, who is based in Brazil, lost R$600 (US$191.02, as of January 30, 2017) as a side effect of information theft.
Upon discovering this, Y immediately called an IT technician to find the root cause.
But since no malware was found in the devices connected to the network, he then reviewed the home router settings.
What he found was interesting:Â  even though the home router did not expose any remote management interface to the internet, the DNS settings were still modified.
In another case, user X noticed R$3,000 (US$955.11, as of January 30, 2017) was deducted from her account last January 2016.
Her home router was also infected with a malicious DNS-changing malware.
Routers often have unsecure configurations that make them susceptible to malware attacks similar to the real-world cases we presented above.
For one, security flaws exist in the operating system, firmware, and web applications of routers.
Attackers can simply use these vulnerabilities as entry points to further compromise the home network.
Web-based scripts are an effective tactic to infiltrate routers.
