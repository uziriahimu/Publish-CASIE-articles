Kaspersky Lab researchers have brought to light a series of attacks leveraged against 140+ banks and other businesses around the world.
But what makes these attacks unusual is the criminals’ use of widely used legitimate tools and fileless malware, which explains why the attacks went largely unnoticed.
“This threat was originally discovered by a bank’s security team, after detecting Meterpreter code inside the physical memory of a domain controller (DC),” the researchers explained.
“Kaspersky Lab participated in the forensic analysis after this attack was detected, discovering the use of PowerShell scripts within the Windows registry.
Additionally it was discovered that the NETSH utility as used for tunnelling traffic from the victim’s host to the attacker´s C2”.
Meterpreter is a well known Metasploit payload that allows attackers to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files.
NETSH (network shell), is a Windows command-line utility that allows local or remote configuration of network devices.
The attackers also took advantage of the Windows SC utility to install a malicious service to execute PowerShell scripts, and Mimikatz to extract credentials from compromised machines.
