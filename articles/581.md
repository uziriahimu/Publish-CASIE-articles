You may have heard of the CEO scam: that’s where spear-phishers impersonate a CEO to hit up a company for sensitive information.
That’s what happened to Snapchat, when an email came in to its payroll department, masked as an email from CEO Evan Spiegel and asking for employee payroll information.
Here’s a turn of that same type of screw: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last week sent out an urgent warning about a new tax season scam that wraps the CEO fraud in with a W-2 scam, then adds a dollop of wire fraud on top.
A W-2 is a US federal tax form, issued by employers, that has a wealth of personal financial information, including taxpayer ID and how much an employee was paid in a year.
This new and nasty dual-phishing scam has moved beyond the corporate world to target nonprofits such as school districts, healthcare organizations, chain restaurants, temporary staffing agencies and tribal organizations.
As with earlier CEO spoofing scams, the crooks are doctoring emails to make the messages look like they’re coming from an organization’s executive.
Sending the phishing messages to employees in payroll or human resources departments, the criminals request a list of all employees and their W-2 forms.
The scam, sometimes referred to as business email compromise (BEC) or business email spoofing (BES), first appeared last year.
This year, it’s not only being sent to a broader set of intended victims; it’s also being sent out earlier in the tax season than last year.
In a new twist, this year’s spam scamwich also features a followup email from that “executive”, sent to payroll or the comptroller, asking for a wire transfer to a certain account.
Some companies have been swindled twice: they’ve lost both employees’ W-2s and thousands of dollars sent out via the wire transfers.
