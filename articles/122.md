<title>Super Mario Run for Android Available for Download… as Malware</title>

Super Mario Run is projected to launch in the Google Play Store in the coming weeks, after previously going live on iOS on December 15, and cybercriminals are trying to benefit from the excitement generated by Nintendo’s new title using a new wave of malware.
Security company zscaler warns that malware disguised as Super Mario Run for Android is now spreading across the Internet, with users encouraged to download APKs that eventually infect devices and attempt to steal financial information.
Specifically, the malicious Super Mario Run for Android package is infected with the Android Marcher Trojan, which now comes disguised as Nintendo’s game, but features a similar behavior to what we’ve seen in the past.
Once it infects an Android device, it opens an overlay that requires users to enter their financial details whenever mobile banking apps are launched, and collected data is then saved and submitted to a command and control center owned by the attacker.
In most of the cases, the Google Play Store can no longer launch as users are provided with the same overlay asking for financial details.
“In previous variants of Marcher, we observed this malware family targeting well-known Australian, UK, and French banks.
The current version is targeting account management apps as well as well-known banks,” zscaler says.
