Cyber criminals took a second swing at Mecklenburg County government on Thursday after officials rejected a demand for money following a ransomware attack.
The follow-up attempts to hold the county hostage over illegally encrypted data came just hours after County Manager Dena Diorio announced she’d decided against paying a hacker ransom. Instead of agreeing to pay criminals, she said Wednesday, the county will rebuild its system applications and restore files and data from backups.
But by Thursday afternoon, hackers tried to strike again.
Diorio sent staff members an email saying, “I have a new warning for employees.”
As the county’s IT staff worked to recover from the first cyberattack, Diorio said, they discovered more attempts to compromise computers and data on Thursday.
“To limit the possibility of a new infection, ITS is disabling employees’ ability to open attachments generated by DropBox and Google Documents,” she wrote in an email. “The best advice for now is to limit your use of emails containing attachments, and try to conduct as much business as possible by phone or in person.”
She described the aftermath of the ransomware attack as a “crisis” and reassured employees they should not feel personally responsible for the incident.
The county first learned of the problem earlier this week after an employee opened a malicious “phishing” email and accessed an attached file that unleashed a widespread problem inside the county’s network of computers and information technology.
The intent of that ransomware attack was to essentially access as many county government files and data servers as possible. Then, the information was encrypted or locked, keeping employees at the county from accessing operating systems and files. The person or people responsible for the infiltration then demanded the county pay two bitcoins, or about $23,000, in exchange for a release of the locked data. The county refused to pay.
County officials say they anticipate the recovery time for Mecklenburg County government operations will take days.
“We are open for business, and we are slow, but there’s no indication of any data loss or that personal information was compromised,” Diorio said.
Diorio said third-party security experts believe the attack earlier this week by a new strain of ransomware called LockCrypt originated from Iran or Ukraine. Forty-eight of about 500 county computer servers were affected.
