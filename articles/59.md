<title>MM Core In-Memory Backdoor Returns as "BigBoss" and "SillyGoose" | Forcepoint</title>

Also known as “BaneChant”, MM Core is a file-less APT which is executed in memory by a downloader component.
It was first reported in 2013 under the version number “2.0-LNK” where it used the tag “BaneChant” in its command-and-control (C2) network request.
A second version “2.1-LNK” with the network tag “StrangeLove” was discovered shortly after.
In this blog we will detail our discovery of the next two versions of MM Core, namely “BigBoss” (2.2-LNK) and “SillyGoose” (2.3-LNK).
Attacks using "BigBoss" appear likely to have occurred since mid-2015, whereas "SillyGoose" appears to have been distributed since September 2016.
In 2013 MM Core was reported to target Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries.
Our own telemetry suggests that both Africa and the United States have also been recent targets.
The following list shows the targeted industries we have observed:
However, the new DOC exploit we found exploits a more recent CVE-2015-1641 Microsoft Word vulnerability which it uses to extract embedded malware.
The extracted malware is then executed by leveraging a DLL side-loading vulnerability.
The DOC file we analysed (SHA1 d336b8424a65f5c0b83328aa89089c2e4ddbcf72) was named “US pak track ii naval dialogues.doc”.
This document exploits CVE-2015-1641 and executes shellcode which drops a legitimate Microsoft executable along with a trojanised DLL named “ChoiceGuard.dll”.
The shellcode then executes the Microsoft executable, causing the malicious DLL to automatically be loaded into the file when it is run - hence the term "side-loading".
The DLL downloads and executes the file-less MM Core backdoor in memory, which uses steganography to hide itself inside a JPEG file.
The JPEG contains code to decrypt itself using the Shikata ga nai algorithm.
Once decrypted and executed in memory, the MM Core backdoor will extract and install an embedded downloader when it is first run and add it to Windows start-up for persistence.
This downloader, which is similar to the first trojanised DLL, is then executed and will download the MM Core JPEG once again, executing it in memory like before.
This time MM Core will conduct its backdoor routine which will send off system information and await further commands.
