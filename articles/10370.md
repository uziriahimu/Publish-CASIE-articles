NETFLIX users are once again being warned not to fall for fake emails asking customers to update their payment details.
The emails claim to be from the streaming service but are actually from scammers trying to steal your money.
The convincing message reads: "We're having some trouble with your current billing information.
"We'll try again, but in the meantime you may want to update your payment details."
At the end of the email, there is a red button that tells you to "Update Account now".
But if you click on it and follow the link, you will be taken to a fake website that is actually run by scammers who may use the information you enter to hack your bank account.
The Federal Trade Commission, a government agency in the US, has now issued an urgent warning about the Netflix "phishing scam" and urged consumers not "take the bait".
"Scammers use your information to steal your money, your identity, or both," it explained.
"They also use phishing emails to get access to your computer or network.
"If you click on a link, they can install ransomware or other programs that can lock you out of your data."
But it's not the first time warnings have been issued over Netflix scams - in September this year Action Fraud did the same over a similar scam.
And earlier in 2017, Netflix users were also hit with a sophisticated ‘phishing’ scam inviting them to type in bank details on a fake login page.
