Hackers made hay of the sorry state of credential security in 2016.
They stole millions of username and password combinations from online services of all shapes and sizes.
Blogs and discussion forums were hit particularly hard.
Exploiting credentials is an old attack vector that still works wonders for hackers.
In its 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), Verizon added a section about credentials, revealing that 63% of data breaches involved weak, default or stolen passwords.
“This statistic drives our recommendation that this is a bar worth raising,” reads the report.
Why is it so easy for cybercriminals to plunder login credentials?
End users, despite constant warnings, continue re-using passwords, allowing hackers to conveniently break into multiple accounts after stealing someone's credentials once.
It's like having one key for your bike lock, front door, office building, car and bank box.
Meanwhile, more software vendors should provide advanced hashing, salting and other scrambling technologies for protecting credential information in case it's stolen.
For example, attackers hacked Clash of Kings' forum after exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated version of the vBulletin software.
The thieves stole personal information from 1.6 million user accounts, including scrambled passwords.
In one case, an attacker used misplaced install files to gain admin privileges.
In another case, hackers stole one moderator's credentials and used the account to post a malicious message in the forum.
After viewing the message, the forum's administrator had his account compromised, leading to a massive breach.
Notable vulnerabilities exploited in recent years include CVE-2016-6483, CVE-2016-6195, CVE-2016-6635, CVE-2015-1431, CVE-2015-7808, CVE-2014-9574 and CVE-2013-6129.
