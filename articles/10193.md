Apple has issued an update to fix a number of issues in macOS Mojave leading to arbitrary code execution, the ability to read restricted memory and access local users Apple IDs among others.
All were patched with the release of macOS Mojave 10.14 on Sept 24.

The first issue, CVE-2018-5383, impacted a number of iMac, MacBook Air, Mac Pro and Mac mini server products. An input validation issue existed in Bluetooth was fixed that could have allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to intercept Bluetooth traffic.
The App Store also patched CVE-2018-4324, an issue in the handling of Apple ID that could have been exploited by a malicious application that would expose the Apple ID of the computerâ€™s owner. Also, a validation issue that could expose Apple IDs was in Auto Unlock that was patched with improved validation of the process entitlement.
CVE-2018-4353 impacted the application firewall where a sandboxed process may be able to circumvent sandbox restrictions, but this was addressed by adding additional restrictions.
In Crash Reporter a validation issue, CVE-2018-4333, was addressed that if exploited would allow a malicious application to read restricted memory.
Two Kernel problems were fixed, CVE-2018-4336 and CVE-2018-4344, that could let an application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
The final problem, CVE-2016-1777, effected Security where an attacker could exploit a weaknesses in the RC4 cryptographic algorithm and was fixed by removing RC4.
