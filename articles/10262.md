Google has released the September 2018 Android security update for the supported Nexus and Pixel devices. The September Android security update fixes as many as 59 issues through two different patch levels and comes as the first update for the devices running Android 9.0 Pie that the search giant released as its latest Android version last month. It addresses vulnerabilities ranging from high to critical. However, Google, as usual, assures that there are no reports of users being affected by the security issues that have been fixed through the new update. The list of compatible devices for the September Android security update includes Pixel 2 ₹ 38,499, Pixel 2 XL ₹ 36,950, Pixel, Pixel XL ₹ 66,991, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P. Essential Products has also separately released the newest Android security update for the Essential Phone.
Detailing the fixes, Google in the latest security bulletin notes that the September Android security patch level dated 2018-09-01 addresses 24 issues, while the security patch level dated 2018-09-05 fixes 35 issues. The update fixes vulnerabilities range from high to critical, and the most severe in the list is a security issue related to the media framework that could let a remote attacker execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted file. Also, it fixes issues within the Android runtime, framework, and library. Google has assured that there are no reports of any active customer exploitation or abuse through the reported issues.
As per the dedicated bulletin for Google devices, the September Android security update includes 15 security fixes and three functional updates. The update improves software version reporting and audio quality over car speakers on all Pixel devices.
