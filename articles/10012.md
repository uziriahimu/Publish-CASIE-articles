LICKING COUNTY
Officials in Licking County tell 10TV that ransom was demanded for an IT hack that impacted the county's phone and computer systems.
A computer virus shut down more than a thousand computers inside the Licking county government center late Tuesday.
A county commissioner says that the virus demanded a payment in Bitcoin for the county to regain control of their systems. Officials declined to specify the amount of money that was requested.
The county said its IT department discovered the problem when some files wouldn't open. As a precaution, it shut the system down and that's when technicians discovered it was a virus known as ransomware.
County business continues, despite the computer shut down, although county employees are having to do much of their work on paper.
