Freelance security researcher Dan Melamed has done us all a solid.
Then, he did the right thing: he reported it to Facebook.
Melamed said in a blog post on Monday that he’d discovered the critical vulnerability in June.
Besides finding a kill switch for any public video, he also discovered he could disable commenting on any video.
Melamed had looked at the HTTP request that his browser sends to Facebook when he uploads a video.
Using a program called Fiddler, he intercepted the request, swapped out his video’s ID for one belonging to a victim’s video, and then sent the modified request on its way to Facebook.
Melamed’s method is simple: first, an attacker would either create a public event on Facebook or visit any existing public event.
Then, they’d go to the event’s Discussion tab and create an event post by uploading a photo or video.
He found that when you swap the value of the composer_unpublished_photo[0] parameter for the ID of the Facebook video you want to kill, the server will balk, putting out this error message:
This content is no longer available.
Error message or no error message, the video will still successfully attach itself to the created event post.
When an attacker refreshes the Events Discussion page, they’d see that the event posting had appeared with the victim’s video attached.
Then, it’s just a matter of clicking a small arrow dropdown and choosing “Delete Post”.
A dialog box will warn that the video will also be removed from Photos and Videos.
If you confirm in the dialog box that yes, you want to delete the video, Poof!
Credit where credit’s due, Melamed noted that this vulnerability is similar to another video deletion bug that Indian security researcher and penetration tester Pranav Hivarekar discovered, also in June 2016.
In a nutshell: whereas Hivarekar’s flaw had to do with attaching a victim’s video to a comment, Melamed discovered a way to attach the video to an event post.
Delete the bath water/event post, and that baby/video gets tossed right out with it.
This one had to do with how one man could have deleted any Facebook photo album that he could see.
Mark offers this digression: In Melamed’s attack on videos, he specifies the ID of a video he’s targeting specifically, but since video IDs are just numbers, he could have just guessed one and wiped out a video at random.
