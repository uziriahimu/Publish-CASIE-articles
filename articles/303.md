<title>Security Researchers Urge The Guardian to Retract WhatsApp “Backdoor” Story</title>

Last week, we reported about a cryptographer who found a supposed vulnerability in WhatsApp and later gave an interview to The Guardian explaining the matter.
The cryptographer later posted videos on YouTube explaining his findings, and WhatsApp’s response to his claims came in a timely manner.
Cryptographer Tobias Boelter claimed that Facebook and WhatsApp could potentially intercept and read encrypted messages sent within the app.
WhatsApp issued a statement saying that the alleged “backdoor” was actually an intentional design decision so that millions of messages could be delivered to their intended recipients.
The developer of WhatsApp’s encryption protocol, Open Whisper Systems, also issued a statement backing up WhatsApp’s claims.
Now it seems that security researchers from around the world have come together to defend WhatsApp and urge The Guardian to retract its story.
