Last week HackRead exclusively reported on a vendor selling over 1 million Gmail and Yahoo accounts on a Dark Web marketplace.
Now, the same vendor is back with yet another listing and this time the victims are PlayStation users.
The vendor who goes by the handle of “SunTzu583” is selling 640,000 accounts of PlayStation users in just USD 35.71 (0.0292 BTC) stolen from an unknown database.
These accounts contain emails along with their clear-text passwords.
According to SunTzu583, the database was not directly stolen from PlayStation servers, but it does contain unique accounts of PlayStation users.
SunTzu583 goes on to explain that these accounts may also work on other sites however they can be mainly used for PlayStation-related activities.
It must be noted that in 2015, 2.5 million Xbox (Xbox 360 ISO) and Playstation accounts (PSP ISO) were stolen and leaked on the Dark Web marketplaces in February 2017.
Also, about five months ago several PlayStation users were complaining that their accounts have been hacked and in some cases, their funds were missing.
While the vendor has already announced that the database is not directly stolen from PlayStation servers, it is quite possible that it was taken from a third party server.
We at HackRead can not confirm the authenticity of this database, but if you have an account on PSN, it is advisable to change its password and also use a different password on other sites.
