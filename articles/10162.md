A Russian vulnerability researcher and exploit developer has published detailed information about a zero-day vulnerability in VirtualBox. His explanations include step-by-step instructions for exploiting the bug.
According to the initial details in the disclosure, the issue is present in a shared code base of the virtualization software, available on all supported operating systems.
Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the virtual environment of the guest machine and reach the Ring 3 privilege layer, used for running code from most user programs, with the least privileges.
Turning one "overflow" into another
Sergey Zelenyuk found that the security bug can be leveraged on virtual machines configured with the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network adapter in Network Address Translation (NAT) mode, the default setup that allows the guest system to access external networks.
"The [Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)] has a vulnerability allowing an attacker with root/administrator privileges in a guest to escape to a host ring3. Then the attacker can use existing techniques to escalate privileges to ring 0 via /dev/vboxdrv," Zelenyuk writes in a technical write-up on Tuesday.
Zelenyuk says that an important aspect in getting how the vulnerability works is to understand that context descriptors are processed before data descriptors.
The researcher describes the mechanics behind the security flaw in detail, showing how to trigger the necessary conditions to obtain a buffer overflow that could be abused to escape the confinements of the virtual operating system.
First, he caused an integer underflow condition using packet descriptors - data segments that allow the network adapter to track network packet data in the system memory.
This state was then leveraged to read data from the guest OS to into a heap buffer and cause an overflow condition that could lead to overwriting function pointers; or to cause a stack overflow condition.
