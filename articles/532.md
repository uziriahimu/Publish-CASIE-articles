Privacy advocates say tech companies are becoming more brazen about collecting users' location data and personal information.
February 6, 2017
—For just a few days last month, a photo filter app called Meitu, which turns selfies into pearl-skinned, doe-eyed Anime characters, enthralled the social media world.
But Meitu faded as quickly as it rose to internet fame after cybersecurity researchers exposed what was really behind the app.
Meitu’s application program interfaces (API) revealed code that collected a bevy of personal data that goes far beyond what typical photo apps gather.
It amassed users' precise locations, call information, carrier information, and Wi-Fi connections.
The company explained that it collected all that data to "optimize app performance" and better engage users.
As smartphones become ubiquitous, app makers are becoming more brazen about collecting personal data, say experts and privacy advocates.
And while iPhones and Android devices have limited privacy settings, most consumers remain in the dark about what companies are collecting and how they are using that information.
"There's been erosion of privacy over the past few years."
In 2015, he cowrote a study that found a dozen or so popular Android apps – from companies such as the Weather Channel and Groupon – collecting location data about every three minutes.
