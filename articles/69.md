The ransomware was delivered via a phishing attack and malicious attachments that locked them out of all their systems.
The Lansing Board of Water & Light chose to pay $25,000 in bitcoin because it was cheaper than replacing all the infected computers and software, which would have cost up to $10 million.
As it is, the incident cost them $2.5 million to wipe the infected computers and beef up their security controls, much of which was covered by insurance.
