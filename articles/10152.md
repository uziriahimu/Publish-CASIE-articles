<title> Depressed Security Researcher Drops Serious 0-Day Windows Exploit On Twitter </title>

Due to the far reaching implications, Security Researchers will typically submit serious 0-day Windows exploits to Microsoft and give the company ample time to patch the vulnerabilities before they can be used to create malware and do harm. A security researcher that goes by the Twitter handle SandboxEscaper, however, decided it would be a good idea to expose a 0-day threat to the world on Twitter, without forewarning Microsoft, and even linked to proof on concept code on GitHub that has since been verified as functional.
The language in the original Tweet prevents me from directly embedding it here. SandboxEscaper essentially said, “Here is the alpc bug as 0day ... I don't ****ing care about life anymore. Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway...”
The official post on the CERT/CC website explains, “The Microsoft Windows task scheduler SchRpcSetSecurity API contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC, which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges. We have confirmed that the public exploit code works on 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems. We have also confirmed compatibility with 32-bit Windows 10 with minor modifications to the public exploit code. Compatibility with other Windows versions is possible with further modifications.”

At this point, Microsoft does not have a patch at the ready, but according to reports a fix will be coming in the next batch of patch Tuesday updates. Because the exploit requires the local execution of code, it doesn’t necessarily warrant an out-of-band update. However, with proof of concept code readily available, it’s possible nefarious individuals could trick less savvy users into running the code and gain full access to their systems. As always, never execute any files from unknown or untrusted sources.The bug lies in the Windows Task Scheduler’s Advanced Local Procedure Call, or ALPC, interface. It allows a local user to gain system level privileges and have free reign over the system to do whatever they want, including overwriting / modifying system files. Will Dormann of CERT/CC verified the original exploit code works on a fully patched Windows 10 x64 installation and later modified the code to work on 32-bit systems as well.
