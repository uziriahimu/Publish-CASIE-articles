<title>WordPress Websites Exposed to Severe Content Injection Vulnerability</title>

So when there is a security flaw in its system, it affects millions of users on the Internet.
Sucuri found a Content Injection or Privilege Escalation vulnerability affecting the REST API allowing an attacker to modify the content of any post or page within a WordPress site.
However, there is good news since Sucuri discretely reported the vulnerability to WordPress security team who handled the matter professionally and informed as many security providers and hosts and implemented a patch before this became public.
In their blog post, Marc Alexandre Montpas from Sucuri stated that “This privilege escalation vulnerability affects the WordPress REST API that was recently added and enabled by default on WordPress 4.7.0.
One of these REST endpoints allows access (via the API) to view, edit, delete and create posts.
Within this particular endpoint, a subtle bug allows visitors to edit any post on the site.
The REST API is enabled by default on all sites using WordPress 4.7.0 or 4.7.1.
We are hiding some technical details to make it harder for the bad guys, but depending on the plugins installed on a site, it can lead to a RCE (remote command execution).
Also, even though the content is passed through wp_kses, there are ways to inject Javascript and HTML through it.
