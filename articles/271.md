In a blog post, Leonov explained that he reported the issue to Facebook in October 2016 according to which the ImageMagick flaw was still active and impacted Facebook.
He also provided Facebook security team with an in-depth proof of concept (PoC) who patched the issue and awarded him a sum of $40,000 through the Bugcrowd payment system.
“Once upon a time on Saturday in October I was testing some big service (not Facebook) when some redirect followed me on Facebook.
“I am glad to be the one of those who broke the Facebook,” said Leonov.
To confirm the payment, The Register has contacted Facebook.
