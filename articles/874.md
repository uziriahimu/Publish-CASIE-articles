<title>Cloudflare chief pledges third-party review of code – Naked Security</title>

Bad as Cloudbleed is, there’s no evidence attackers exploited it before the patch was deployed.
But since the vulnerability was triggered more than 1.2m times from 6,500 sites, Cloudflare is taking no chances: the company has tapped an outside company, Veracode, to scour its code.
CEO Matthew Prince pledged the external review as he set out a detailed update after 12 days of investigation.
That update includes a synopsis of how the vulnerability was created and who faced the most risk.
He said Cloudflare continues to work with Google and others to eliminate all leaked data from memory:
We’ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages.
That underestimates the total number because we’ve requested search engines purge and re-crawl entire sites in some instances.
Cloudbleed is a serious vulnerability in Cloudflare’s internet infrastructure that Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered in mid-February.
It turned out that a single character in Cloudflare’s code caused the problem.
In its initial blog post on the matter, Cloudflare said the issue stemmed from its decision to use a new HTML parser called cf-html.
In his update, Prince said Cloudbleed was triggered when a page with two characteristics was requested through Cloudflare’s network.
